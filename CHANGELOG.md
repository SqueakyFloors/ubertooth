# Changelog

## 2020-12-R1+modern1

### New features

- ubertooth-btle can stream packet capture (PCAP) data to stdout with `-q -`
  or `-c -`, safely separating diagnostics for Wireshark and other consumers.

  [#7](https://github.com/SqueakyFloors/ubertooth/issues/7)
  [upstream #362](https://github.com/greatscottgadgets/ubertooth/pull/362)
- Every `-U` option accepts either a Universal Serial Bus (USB) enumeration
  index or stable serial number, and multi-device messages make selectors clear
  without dumping full help text. With several devices and no `-U`,
  `ubertooth-util` read-only queries (`-s`, `-v`, `-V`, `-p`, `-b`, alone or
  combined) report every device and exit non-zero if a device cannot be opened
  or a query fails; `-U all` requests that listing explicitly, even for one
  device, and is refused for every other option.

  [#27](https://github.com/SqueakyFloors/ubertooth/issues/27)
  [#28](https://github.com/SqueakyFloors/ubertooth/issues/28)
- `install.sh` provides one-command source installation on Debian/Ubuntu and on
  macOS with Homebrew, with optional virtual environments, a custom `--prefix`,
  `--skip-deps` for already-installed packages, udev setup on Linux, firmware
  builds, and explicitly selected flashing through
  `--flash-device <index|serial|all>`, which now recognises several attached
  boards and refuses to skip one it cannot read.
  [#23](https://github.com/SqueakyFloors/ubertooth/issues/23)
  [#25](https://github.com/SqueakyFloors/ubertooth/issues/25)
- `install.sh` stops with a clear error, before installing or building
  anything, when Python is older than 3.8. [#154](https://github.com/SqueakyFloors/ubertooth/issues/154)
- `install.sh` installs `libnewlib-arm-none-eabi` explicitly, and its apt hint
  names `python3-pyqt5` (Ubuntu has no `python3-pyside6` before 24.10).
  [#152](https://github.com/SqueakyFloors/ubertooth/issues/152)
  [#154](https://github.com/SqueakyFloors/ubertooth/issues/154)
- `ubertooth-util -H`/`--host-version` reports the installed host-tools
  version without a device.
- `ubertooth-util -I` blinks light-emitting diodes (LEDs) faster for easier
  identification and turns them off when interrupted with Ctrl-C.
- `ubertooth-specan-ui` draws a slowly smoothed average of the max-hold trace
  as a cyan dotted line labelled "Avg: N dBm", shown with the other markers.

  [#75](https://github.com/SqueakyFloors/ubertooth/issues/75)
  https://github.com/siriobalmelli-foss/ubertooth/commit/01c3bf9e
- `ubertooth-specan-ui` shows its keys on screen (press `h`; a hint is always
  visible), labels frequencies in whole MHz, no longer leaves ghost marker
  labels behind, draws the plot slightly wider than the scanned range, and has
  a man page and usage guide.

### Build and compatibility

- Python tools are installed natively under the chosen CMake prefix, so
  custom prefixes and staged installs work without modifying the source tree
  or requiring `PYTHONPATH`.
  [#33](https://github.com/SqueakyFloors/ubertooth/issues/33)
- CMake skips the Python tools with a warning when Python is older than 3.8
  (an error with `-DREQUIRE_ALL=ON`) and names the interpreter it uses.
  [#91](https://github.com/SqueakyFloors/ubertooth/issues/91)
- Modern CMake and macOS builds are supported, including CMake 4 policy
  compatibility, Homebrew libusb headers, corrected cache/error declarations,
  and protection against system `MAX`/`MIN` macro collisions.
  [upstream #551](https://github.com/greatscottgadgets/ubertooth/issues/551)
- Python 3.12 and current setuptools releases are supported. Credit: Arnaud
  Rebillout ([@elboulangero](https://github.com/elboulangero)) and Rhys Perry
  ([@rhysperry111](https://github.com/rhysperry111)).
  [upstream #524](https://github.com/greatscottgadgets/ubertooth/pull/524)
- CMake reports which optional host tools are enabled; `REQUIRE_ALL=ON` makes
  missing optional dependencies fatal, with requirements documented by tool.
- Correct the firmware-build `ubertooth-dfu` variable. Credit: Michael Ossmann
  ([@mossmann](https://github.com/mossmann)).
  [upstream #485](https://github.com/greatscottgadgets/ubertooth/pull/485)
- Replace deprecated Scapy packet-reading usage with `PcapReader`. Credit:
  [@stryngs](https://github.com/stryngs).
  [upstream #519](https://github.com/greatscottgadgets/ubertooth/pull/519)

### Reliability fixes

- `ubertooth-dfu` now performs bounded, device-specific Device Firmware
  Upgrade (DFU) entry and recovery, retries interrupted transfers, and verifies
  that the selected device returns with the expected firmware revision.
  [#29](https://github.com/SqueakyFloors/ubertooth/issues/29)
  [#31](https://github.com/SqueakyFloors/ubertooth/issues/31)
  [#35](https://github.com/SqueakyFloors/ubertooth/issues/35)
- `ubertooth-ducky -U` now selects devices by index or serial number.
  [#36](https://github.com/SqueakyFloors/ubertooth/issues/36)
- `ubertooth-specan -l`/`-u` now require valid, ordered in-band frequencies
  before opening the device.
  [#37](https://github.com/SqueakyFloors/ubertooth/issues/37)
- `ubertooth-btle -t none` now reliably clears the persistent target filter.
  [#38](https://github.com/SqueakyFloors/ubertooth/issues/38)
- `ubertooth-ego` rejects malformed and out-of-range packet lengths before
  opening the device.
  [#39](https://github.com/SqueakyFloors/ubertooth/issues/39)
- Firmware received signal strength indicator (RSSI) averaging now rounds
  negative decibels relative to one milliwatt (dBm) correctly.
  [#15](https://github.com/SqueakyFloors/ubertooth/issues/15)
- Firmware version strings and header dependencies now update reliably after
  source or revision changes, including GNU Make 3.81 and source archives.
  [#30](https://github.com/SqueakyFloors/ubertooth/issues/30)
- `ubertooth-util` stops a previous operation before starting a new mode and
  validates both frequency and channel-number arguments.
  [#22](https://github.com/SqueakyFloors/ubertooth/issues/22)
  [#5](https://github.com/SqueakyFloors/ubertooth/issues/5)
  [upstream #448](https://github.com/greatscottgadgets/ubertooth/issues/448)
- `ubertooth-util` exits 0 after a successful query such as `-b`, `-c`, `-a`,
  or `-z`, and an earlier failure is no longer hidden by a later success.
  [#40](https://github.com/SqueakyFloors/ubertooth/issues/40)
- `ubertooth-util` no longer prints error codes as values when a query read
  fails (`-c`, `-a`, `-z`, `-l`, `-d`, `-m`, `-9`); it names the failed read on
  standard error instead, as `-b`, `-p` and `-s` now also do. A failed `-9`
  test command now exits non-zero.
  [#59](https://github.com/SqueakyFloors/ubertooth/issues/59)
  [#123](https://github.com/SqueakyFloors/ubertooth/issues/123)
- Host-library failures now propagate correctly and release device resources;
  firmware-image and ducky operations reject short reads.
  [#2](https://github.com/SqueakyFloors/ubertooth/issues/2)
- `ubertooth-util -p` exits non-zero when the device reports a failed part ID
  read instead of printing `Part ID: 0`. In libubertooth, `cmd_get_partnum()`
  now returns a negative error for that case (it returned 0), and the new
  `cmd_get_part_id()` returns the full unsigned 32-bit ID.
  [#52](https://github.com/SqueakyFloors/ubertooth/issues/52)
- `ubertooth-util -v` and `-V` now exit with an error when the firmware
  version can't be read, instead of printing `error: <n>`.
  [#51](https://github.com/SqueakyFloors/ubertooth/issues/51)
- `ubertooth-util` now releases the device when it finishes a command,
  without stopping a running mode.
  [#117](https://github.com/SqueakyFloors/ubertooth/issues/117)
- `ubertooth-util -r` waits up to 10 seconds for the device to re-enumerate
  (by serial with `-U <serial>`) instead of a fixed 2 seconds, so a slow macOS
  re-enumeration no longer fails a successful reset. libubertooth adds
  `ubertooth_start_select_quiet()` for this silent, STOP-free polling, and
  `ubertooth_count()` no longer leaves libusb initialised.
  [#94](https://github.com/SqueakyFloors/ubertooth/issues/94)
- `ubertooth-util -a0` sets PA level 0 instead of reading the level, and a
  level outside 0-7 is refused before opening the device.
  [#161](https://github.com/SqueakyFloors/ubertooth/issues/161)
- `ubertooth-util` refuses `-z` combined with a mode option, where it silently
  had no effect: a mode stops the device, which resets the squelch.
  [#159](https://github.com/SqueakyFloors/ubertooth/issues/159)
- libubertooth's fixed-size reads (channel, LEDs, PA level, squelch, board ID,
  serial, range result and others) report a short reply as an error instead of
  returning a value made from stale bytes, such as channel 0 right after
  hopping starts. [#149](https://github.com/SqueakyFloors/ubertooth/issues/149)
- `ubertooth-util` refuses a word that is not an option, such as `- V`, with an
  error and exit 1 before opening the device, instead of ignoring it and
  running the rest of the command. Option values may now be the next word:
  `-c 2440` sets the channel like `-c2440` (it used to read the channel).
  [#146](https://github.com/SqueakyFloors/ubertooth/issues/146)
- `ubertooth-util` refuses two or more mode options (`-q`, `-n`, `-e`, `-t`,
  `-x`, `-I`, `-i`, `-f`) with an error and exit 1 before opening the device,
  instead of running only one of them and exiting 0.
  [#82](https://github.com/SqueakyFloors/ubertooth/issues/82)
- `ubertooth-specan-ui` plots again: it passed `-U 0` to `ubertooth-specan` as a
  single argument, which was read as a serial, and asked for 2400-2483 MHz,
  which `ubertooth-specan` rejects. Its `-U` now takes an index or a serial like
  the other tools, and it no longer crashes when `C` is pressed before data
  arrives.
  [#124](https://github.com/SqueakyFloors/ubertooth/issues/124)
- `ubertooth-scan` no longer leaks connection information after failed probes.
  [#3](https://github.com/SqueakyFloors/ubertooth/issues/3)
  [upstream #542](https://github.com/greatscottgadgets/ubertooth/issues/542)
- Prevent Adaptive Frequency Hopping (AFH) divide-by-zero failures in both
  baseband hop implementations. Credit: [@Kielukel](https://github.com/Kielukel) and Piotr Wasylów.
  https://github.com/Kielukel/ubertooth
- Firmware AFH hopping (`ubertooth-follow` with an AFH map) now follows the
  piconet's used channels instead of sitting on 2402 MHz, matching the
  Bluetooth spec's re-mapping and same-channel rules. A new AFH map now takes
  effect at once, including in sweep and `ubertooth-afh` modes.
  [#34](https://github.com/SqueakyFloors/ubertooth/issues/34)
- Correct Bluetooth Low Energy cyclic redundancy check filtering and perform
  verification in the physical-layer engine. Credit: oliver
  ([@Oliver0804](https://github.com/Oliver0804)).
  [upstream #550](https://github.com/greatscottgadgets/ubertooth/pull/550)
- Correct firmware signal-strength channel bounds. Credit: Gabriele
  Gristina ([@matrix](https://github.com/matrix)).
  [upstream #481](https://github.com/greatscottgadgets/ubertooth/pull/481)
- Improve Classic Bluetooth paging speed and reliability. Credit: Hillel
  Chimowicz ([@hllhll](https://github.com/hllhll)).
  [upstream #540](https://github.com/greatscottgadgets/ubertooth/pull/540)

## 2017-03-R2

- USB API versioning - We have added USB API versioning to improve the
  experience of failures due to mismatched firmware and host code. You may
  find that Ubertooth tools complain that your firmware is out of date.
  Updating firmware is simple and reliable, please follow the instructions
  on the wiki. A release archive with precompiled firmware is available.
- Basic Rate PCAP output - the pcap file produced by the Ubertooth tools
  should all be read by the latest Wireshark versions without the need to
  install plugins.
- Kismet plugins - Kismet is currently under heavy development and it has
  not been possible to continue tracking the master branch. The legacy
  Kismet plugins should continue to work, but we will wait to track git
  master until development has stabalised.
